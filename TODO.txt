TODO: 
 //   - Insert food menu
    - Correlation computation and show on 'Summary' page
        -- Put a table on the right side
//    - Select insertion date
//    - Redirect after submit
    - Summary button
//    - It shouldn't be possible to add the same food twice
    - Options to delete food - near each food? - Maybe a cool bootstrap button!?
//    - Change 'Insert your own food' to a simple text. Add a javascript that allows to submit when enter is pressed.
